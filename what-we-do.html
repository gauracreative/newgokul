  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We are all perpetually joy-seeking beings. As described on the <a href="/what-we-believe">what we believe</a> page, the key to true happiness lies in the loving service of God. Though love is an intrinsic and natural quality of the soul, it must be reawakened due to our long-standing association with the material world. To revive our consciousness and experience boundless joy, the Vedic scriptures outline several powerful and effective practices. Below, we briefly describe the three most essential and beneficial of these practices.</p>

<h3 id="devotional-chanting--kirtan">Devotional Chanting – Kirtan</h3>

<p><strong>Kirtan</strong> means “glorification”. In the material world, love naturally compels us to see the good qualities in our beloved and to glorify them. Just as a mother delights in saying her child’s name and finds it sweet, spiritually awakened souls revel in chanting Krishna’s names and recounting His limitless, amazing qualities and pastimes. Even if we may not yet fully connect with Krishna or feel that love, the holy names work in reverse: by chanting, we gradually revive our innate propensity for love, and our understanding that Krishna is the perfect beloved will deepen. The holy names of Krishna are as powerful as Krishna Himself—in fact, they are non-different from Him.</p>

<p>The simplest and most popular form of kirtan is group singing of His names, as demonstrated in the video below.</p>

<div class="video-box"><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YI4zgnBj_o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>In the modern world, many ideas compete for the attention of a person seeking to love God. We often prioritize making money, building a career, and creating a family—all important pursuits that need to be balanced with spiritual growth. This balance requires philosophy, discussion, and education. Discussion involves two key elements: speaking and hearing. The act of speaking in this context is also <strong>kirtanam</strong>—glorification of God. The act of hearing is called <strong>sravanam</strong>, another essential spiritual practice. This is not “just hearing,” but intentional, eager listening—an active desire to receive and internalize the knowledge shared. Similarly, <strong>kirtanam</strong> is not “just speaking,” but glorifying the Supreme with sincerity and purity, without material motives.</p>

<p>When one is genuinely interested in a subject, they naturally seek out like-minded individuals, especially those more knowledgeable in the field. This principle applies here as well, with the crucial difference being that the focus of mutual interest is Krishna, the Supreme Being.
This is also known as <strong>sat-sang</strong>, and it is a central objective at New Gokul. We hold sat-sang daily, creating a space for spiritual fellowship and learning. Additionally, several times a year, we are blessed with visits from traveling sat-sang masters or saints, who share their wisdom and speak about Krishna for days at a time.</p>

<p>We also engage in multiple kirtans every day. This dedication to kirtan and sat-sang lies at the heart of our community. Our mission is to ensure that everyone’s curiosity about Krishna and our eternal loving connection with Him is not only met but deeply nourished and fulfilled.</p>

<p>Beautiful, sweet <strong>kirtan</strong> lead by <strong><a href="https://www.purebhakti.com/teachers/bhakti-yoga-masters/791-sri-srimad-bhaktivedanta-narayana-gosvami-maharaja.html">Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana Goswami Maharaja</a></strong> (recorded in 1989)…</p>
